# Trying to make things work with the Config system currently in place from the ringdown package

So this is the attempt to move from the config file system currently set in place in the `analysis.py` file, and replace it with the latest ringdown package set up, so that things work with `fit.from_config(...)`

Over here I am creating a new virtual environment with both `ringdb` and the new `ringdown` package.
